 # Gpx Gallery app

 An interactive web application for displaying selected gpx-tracks on an interactive map

 This program is a web application that allows users to view and interact with GPS tracks stored in a GitHub repository.
 When started, the program fetches the list of tracks from the GitHub repository and displays them in a table. Following that,
 additionallly, the program fetches metadata for each track from the GPX files and updates the table with this metadata.
 The user can browse the table contents, sort the table on different columns and filter the table by track names.
 When the user wants the currently displayed tracks to be visualized on the table s/he just clicks a refresh button.

 By double-clicking on a single row the user can open the selected track in the "FancySlider" application with detailed (visual)
 analysis of that particular track.
 
 For a selected pair of tracks the user can open the "GpxRace" app to compare the selected tracks.
