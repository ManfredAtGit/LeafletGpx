This code represents the header section of an HTML page that sets up a web-based GPS track visualization system. Let me break down its main components:

Purpose: The code sets up the necessary resources and styling for displaying an interactive map with GPS track data. It creates a clean, modern interface with a control panel that includes a slider and buttons for track playback.

##Inputs:

- External resources like Leaflet (for maps), jQuery (for UI controls), and Font Awesome (for icons)
- A custom JavaScript file (track-animation-fancySlider.js) that handles the animation logic
- CSS styles that define the appearance of the control panel and its components

##Outputs:

- A styled control panel with:
-- Track information display (distance and elevation)
-- A smooth, modern-looking slider
-- Play/pause and reset buttons
-- A tooltip for displaying information
-- Visual styling for all interactive elements

##How it Works:
The code achieves its purpose through:

- Loading necessary libraries and frameworks through CDN links
- Defining CSS styles that create a professional-looking interface
- Setting up the structure for a control panel that will interact with the map


##Important styling features:

- The control panel is centered with a width of 600px and has a subtle shadow
- The slider is customized with a blue handle and smooth transitions
- Buttons are circular with hover effects
- The layout uses flexbox for clean alignment of elements
- Color scheme is primarily based on blue (#2196F3) with appropriate contrast for text
